## ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Scott.

**For Work:**
I'm a software engineer currently contracting for Microsoft, working on the UI and associated APIs for [Chaos Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/chaos-studio_), a service in Azure allowing customers to test and improve the resiliency of their applications by injecting faults into their cloud infrastructure.

**For Fun:**
You can usually find me drumming or gravel biking around Seattle, WA.

## Tech
As a result of my experience in consulting for a variety of enterprise clients, I would describe myself as a cloud-focused full stack engineer, and my most commonly used frameworks/languages/libraries include:

JavaScript | TypeScript | Node | React | Redux | RxJs | .NET

I have experience in both AWS and Azure, having built many microservices and APIs for a variety of use cases.
