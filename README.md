**For Work:**  
I'm a front-end engineer contractor currently working at Microsoft to build out UI for a new Azure service. Previously, I was at [Slalom Build](https://www.slalombuild.com/) building software for a variety of enterprise clients using modern web technologies, and serverless backend architectures.

**For Fun:**  
You can find me drumming, recording music with [Gumshen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ynnDWaJZ6KwwQDdjiEYI6), and exploring the outdoors here in Seattle, WA.

## Tech
My focus is front-end development, and my most common frameworks/languages/libraries include:

JavaScript | TypeScript | React | HTML | CSS | Redux | RxJs
