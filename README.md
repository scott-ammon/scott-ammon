**For work**, I'm an engineer at [Slalom Build](https://www.slalombuild.com/) where we help enterprise clients reach their technology goals. Most of my work revolves around modern web technologies, and serverless backend architectures.

**For fun** you can find me drumming, recording music with [Gumshen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ynnDWaJZ6KwwQDdjiEYI6), and exploring the outdoors here in Seattle, WA.

## Tech Stack

While working as consultants requires us to dip our feet into several different languages and frameworks with each new project, I focus on:

JavaScript | Node | React | HTML | CSS | AWS

## Talks
Ok, there's only one... but it was a fun one. Check out my speaker page on [CascadiaJS](https://2020.cascadiajs.com/speakers/scott-ammon) for my talk on connecting MIDI instruments to the browser.
