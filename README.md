**For work**, I'm an engineer at Slalom Build where we help enterprise clients reach their technology goals. Most of my work revolves around modern web technologies, and serverless backend architectures. While my work is not public or reflected here on GitHub, head over to [Slalom Build](https://www.slalombuild.com/) to check out some of the awesome work we do.

**For fun** you can find me drumming, recording music with [Gumshen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ynnDWaJZ6KwwQDdjiEYI6), and exploring the outdoors here in Seattle, WA.

## Tech Stack

While working as consultants requires us to dip our feet into several different languages and frameworks with each new project, I focus on:

JavaScript | Node | React | HTML | CSS | AWS
